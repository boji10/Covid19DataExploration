#Analysis of Covid Deaths and Vaccinations


In this project, I imported the Covid Deaths and Vaccinations tables and processed the data using aggregate functions, joins, and CTEs. I also created views in SQL to make the data easier to analyze.

Data sources
The dataset used for this analysis is: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths
